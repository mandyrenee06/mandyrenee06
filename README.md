# Hi there, I'm Amanda! 👋


## About Me 🚀

I’m a Computer Science student who’s currently exploring the world of frontend development and discovering how creativity meets technology. I may not have years of experience yet, but I love learning new things, experimenting with ideas, and turning small projects into big learning moments.

- 🌱 Currently learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
- 🔭 Working on: personal projects to sharpen my frontend skills
- 🌍 Languages: English (fluent), and I’m picking up a bit of Python and JavaScript
- 📫 How to reach me: amandarenee195@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy figuring out how everyday apps work and trying to recreate them from scratch just for fun!

## My Skills 🧠
These are the technologies I’m currently learning and practicing as I build my foundation in frontend development:

CSS and
REACT



## Learning Journey 🌱
I’m currently focusing on building my frontend skills — learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.  
I plan to start creating small web projects soon to apply what I’ve learned and share my progress here.
I’m practicing small projects like layouts, interactive buttons, and simple websites as I improve my coding skills.

I’ll be sharing my first real projects here soon — so stay tuned as I grow, create, and learn along the way! 🚀
